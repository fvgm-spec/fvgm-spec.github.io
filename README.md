## Felix Gutierrez personal portfolio.

On this website, the main project in which I have worked are published. Many of them have been generated as a product of courses carried out, MOOCs, research, and the need to learn new libraries to develop in my profession. Most of the projects/analysis are developed in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), and making use of the most common used packages for data analysis in Python, such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), among others.
