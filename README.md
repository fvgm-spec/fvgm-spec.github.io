## Felix Gutierrez personal portfolio.

The following is a sample of the main projects I have been working on, most of them are published in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fvgm-spec). Many of them have been generated as a product of courses carried out, MOOCs, research, and the need to learn new libraries to develop in my profession. Most of the projects/analysis were developed in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), and making use of the most common used packages for data analysis in Python, such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), among others.

My projects includes:

### **Data Analysis**

**Summary:** Through this notebook, I analyzed the covid cases appearing around the world from [Our World In Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data). I used libraries such as pandas, [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to generate a lineplot like the one shown below, which shows the evolution of covid new cases in the country where I currently live, which is Uruguay.
