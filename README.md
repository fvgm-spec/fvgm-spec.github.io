## Felix Gutierrez personal portfolio.

The following is a sample of the main projects I have been working on, most of them are published in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fvgm-spec). Many of them have been generated as a product of courses carried out, MOOCs, research, and the need to learn new libraries to develop in my profession. Most of the projects/analysis were developed in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), and making use of the most common used packages for data analysis in Python, such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), among others.

My projects includes:

### **Data Analysis**

**Summary:** Through this repository I have made projects that make use of Python libraries to perform basic data analysis, EDA, giving quick insights on data analyzed.

_Sample notebook_

#### _Covid data analysis_
Through this notebook, I analyzed the covid cases appearing around the world from [Our World In Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data). I used libraries such as pandas, [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to generate a lineplot like the one shown below, which shows the evolution of covid new cases in the country where I currently live, which is Uruguay.

For more details check the code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fvgm-spec/data_analysis/blob/main/covid_data_analysis.ipynb)

 ### **Data Science** 
 
**Summary:** In this repository I use data science techniques that range from exploratory analysis to visualization through statistical methods. For this I use Python libraries for data analysis, visualization and manipulation, such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html).  

_Sample notebook_

#### _Fibonacci series analysis_
In this Jupyter Notebook, I have compiled a qulick tutorial about history and a practical application in Python of Fibonacci series.

For more details, the code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fvgm-spec/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/fibonacci_series.ipynb)


### **Machine Learning**

**Summary:** This repository goes a step beyond the techniques for data science analysis, using Python libraries for Machine Learning.

_Sample notebook_

#### _Scikit Learn toy datasets_
In this notebook I resumed the sample datasets available through the scikit learn API, and they are very useful to pu in practice Machine Learning algorithms from this library. 


For more details, the code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fvgm-spec/ML/blob/main/notebooks/Sklearn%20toy%20datasets.ipynb)
